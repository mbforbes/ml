# mnist

Joseph Redmon did the great work of putting MNIST in a nice format in CSV. They're not on his website anymore, but they're floating around the internet in a few places. I downloaded from:
https://github.com/phoebetronic/mnist

Put them in:
- `data/mnist/original/mnist_train.csv`
- `data/mnist/original/mnist_test.csv`
